# scandipwa-no-minimize
This package disables ScandiPWA/React webpack minimization.

## Requisities - for adding an extension only!
You don't need to have this tool on your server, it's only for adding an extension:
 
ScandiPWA CLI - https://docs.scandipwa.com/developing-with-scandi/developer-tools/scandipwa-cli

### Installation
From your root scandipwa folder run:

`scandipwa extension install disable-minimize`

This command will add to your `package.json` all needed lines.
